# tomvsaji.github.io
A sample  project made for application purpose.
Frameworks used:
React, Bootstrap
Technologies used:HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT

The project contains a search bar that allows you to input twitter handles of  people, only four of them will be  selected and the timeline of each of these handles will be displayed in separate  columns below.

However I am not able to use the twitter API to grab tweets, therefore a sample profile is shown representing how the tweets would have been displayed

The search bar works, filtering only four names separated using  commas or space,  and successfully  maps a  function  that prints out  their  name below, if the  API  would  have worked these  would  have  been  individual profiles.

States are used  to handle the  input and also the array containing  the  filtered four names.
I also made the app version  where everything is in folder, but  as this is much simpler  in  three files
